Some species are adapted to grow in extreme conditions such as high altitudes, arid regions, and dry climates.  They can also be found in deserts, forests, and grasslands.  They can be grown indoors or outdoors.  They have a wide range of colors, shapes, and sizes.  Some are long-lived, and some are short-lived.  They can be grown in containers, or in the ground.  They are typically grown in the spring and summer, and then can be stored for the winter months.  They can be propagated by cuttings or seed.

But this is not a common side effect, and it’s not caused by the medicine.  It’s a different problem that’s called “depression”, which is a mental illness, not a drug side effect.  People with depression are often treated with anti-depressants, but sometimes people with depression have other mental illnesses that make them more likely to think about suicide.  There are also people who are suicidal who don’t take anti-depressants, and sometimes they also have other mental illnesses.<|eot_id|>",

For example, the physical components of a computer are made up of the motherboard, the central processing unit, and the input/output devices.  Computer architecture is the way these physical components are designed to work together.  For example, the motherboard and central processing unit are usually built together, but they can be built separately.<|eot_id|>",

It’s a mathematical rule for calculating the derivative of a function, and it’s named after a French mathematician who lived in the 17th century.  In the context of calculus, the derivative of a function is the slope of the tangent line at a point on the graph.  So, L’Hopital’s Rule says that if two functions have the same derivative at a point, and if the slope of the tangent line at that point is the same as the slope of the original function, then the two functions are equal.  So, for example, if I take the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 and the function g(x) = 2x, and I get that they both have the same slope at x = 1, then I can use L’Hopital’s Rule to show that f(x) = g(x).<|eot_id|>",

If you have a hot water boiler then the heating is likely to be more efficient than electric, since you can use less energy, and the hot water is heated directly by the boiler.

Every atom is made of a nucleus and electrons.  The nucleus has a very small amount of mass, but it is very important because it has a strong pull on the electrons, and this pulls the electrons closer to the nucleus, and also pulls them away from other atoms.  The electrons are also pulled by other atoms, which causes them to move around and move closer to or further away from the nucleus.<|eot_id|>",

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

I’d suggest that you start with the legs, which are the largest muscles in the body.  You’ll want to start with your legs parallel to the floor, with your heels on the ground.  Then you’ll want to lift your legs up and out, and keep them in the air as you rotate your torso to the side.  You’ll want to keep your back straight and your core muscles tight.  Do this for a few seconds, and then return to the starting position.  I’d recommend doing a few sets of 10 reps, and then rest for a few minutes.<|eot_id|>",

The most important thing to know is that the environmental impact of plastic is very bad.  For example, it takes many years for plastic to decompose, so even after it’s in the environment, it’s not going to be biodegradable.  It’s also a significant source of microplastics, which are smaller than a millimeter, and they can then get into the food chain and enter people’s bodies.  Also, plastic can leach chemicals into the environment, and the chemicals in plastic are very dangerous to humans.<|eot_id|>",

    "output": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI’m happy to talk about it.  The process is very similar to the process of DNA replication.  In order to make changes in a gene, a molecule of DNA is cut and replaced with a new DNA molecule.  In this case, the new DNA is cut and replaced with a different sequence of DNA, and the process is repeated to make a change in the gene.  There are many different types of DNA repair systems in our cells, and the repair process is usually carried out by a protein called DNA polymerase.  This protein is usually provided by the cell, but can be replaced by a synthetic version, which is called a “guide RNA” or “guide molecule”.  The guide RNA is a short piece of DNA that’s complementary to the sequence of the gene to be changed.  When a gene is cut, the DNA polymerase binds to the cut site, and then the guide RNA attaches to the end of the DNA polymerase.  The guide RNA then guides the DNA polymerase to the cut site and cuts the DNA at that site, while also providing a template for the polymerase to fill in the gap.<|eot_id|>",

    "output": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is a very interesting question.  I think there are many factors that influence people’s eating habits, and they’re not all related to food.  For example, I think that the media plays a big role in shaping people’s eating habits, especially children, by showing them what they should eat and how they should act in public.  People also have their own experiences with food and how they feel about it, which can also influence their eating habits.  For example, some people feel that food is a form of social interaction, so they enjoy eating with others.  Other people feel that food is a source of comfort and pleasure, and they feel bad when they don’t eat.  So you can see how many factors can influence a person’s eating habits.  If you want to change people’s eating habits, you might want to try to find out what the people who are eating well are doing, and then try to figure out how you can do the same.<|eot_id|>",

    "output": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nIt’s a fascinating question! I think that there are a lot of reasons why some people are scared and some are not.  In general, the more a person is willing to experience a feeling, the more they’re likely to enjoy it.  So the people who enjoy being scared probably have a more adventurous personality, and have experienced more scary things in their life.<|eot_id|>",

    "output": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nIt depends on the situation.  For example, if you are observing a group of people in a restaurant, and the women are all wearing very skimpy outfits, it might be a sign that the restaurant is a “gentleman’s club”, and men might be more inclined to have sex with the women there.  If you are watching people in a park and they are all wearing very expensive clothing, it might be a sign that the people are rich and have a lot of money.  If you are watching people in a movie theater, and they are all wearing very expensive clothing, it might be a sign that they are wealthy.  If you are watching people in a classroom, and they are all wearing very expensive clothing, it might be a sign that the teacher is wealthy.  If you are watching people on a street, and they are all wearing very expensive clothing, it might be a sign that the people are wealthy.  If you are watching people in a hospital, and they are all wearing very expensive clothing, it might be a sign that the people are wealthy.
