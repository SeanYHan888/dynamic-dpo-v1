    "output": "assistant\n\nOil is a fossil fuel, and is made from dead plants and animals that lived millions of years ago.  When plants and animals died, their remains were buried and decomposed into oil.  The oil was then turned into gasoline by adding hydrogen and oxygen, which are also present in the air.  Hydrogen and oxygen are also found in water, and when they are added to oil, they are used to break the oil down into its constituent parts.  The parts are then distilled to remove impurities.",

    "output": "assistant\n\nHm, I’m not an expert in bicycle mechanics, but I think the most likely culprit is that your chain is coming apart.  A loose or damaged chain can cause a lot of noise, and could even damage the chain, which would be very bad.  If the chain is not working properly, you might want to check that your chain is tight enough, and that the tension is even.  You can do this by tightening the chain with a tool called a “chain breaker”, and also by adjusting the tension with a “chain adjuster”.  Do you have a chain breaker?",

Cashews are a type of nut that is high in calories and fat, so they can be a good source of energy.  But they also have a lot of fat, so you might not want to eat too many.  You might also want to avoid eating nuts that are high in sugar, because they can have a lot of calories and are high in fat.  Some nuts are better for you than others, so it depends on your goals.",
