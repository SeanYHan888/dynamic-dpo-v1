Many of his novels were critical of slavery and the inequalities of the time, and were written in a way that was intended to be moralizing, rather than to be an accurate reflection of the world.  This is called “realism”.  Dickens was accused of writing antisemitic because some people thought he was saying that Jews were greedy and unprincipled, and that they were trying to exploit poor people.  This is what antisemitism is.",

To warm up your hamstrings, start with a plank, and then go down onto your forearms, keeping your elbows locked, and hold for 30 seconds.  Then go back up to the plank, and repeat.\n2.  To strengthen your arms, do some push-ups.  If you’re not able to do them, try doing a modified push-up by putting your hands on the ground, and then raising your body up to a push-up position, and then lowering your body down to the starting position.\n3.  To stretch your legs, try doing some squats.  If you’re not able to do them, try doing a modified squat, where you put your hands on a chair and squat down.\n4.  If you’re feeling like your back is tight, try doing some spinal extensions.  Lie down on your back on a mat, and lift your head and shoulders up off the mat, and then lower your head and shoulders back down to the mat.",

They’re formed when a volcano opens up and lets out magma that’s coming up from the Earth’s crust.  But there are also some volcanoes that are formed by “calderas”, which are really big holes in the Earth’s crust.  They’re formed when there’s a huge amount of pressure and heat in the Earth’s crust, and it’s just suddenly forced out through the Earth’s crust.  That’s why they’re called caldera volcanoes.",

When you eat food, it goes into the bloodstream and gets carried to the liver and then to the fat cells.  But if you have a belly button, you have a lot of blood vessels that carry blood to your skin.  When you get pregnant, your body produces extra hormones to help your baby grow, and this extra hormone is called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).  This hormone can cause the belly to grow, and it also causes the fat cells to grow in the belly.",
